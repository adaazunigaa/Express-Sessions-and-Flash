SESSIONS
    What are they?
        It is not very practical (or secure) to store a lot of data  client-side using 
        cookies. This is where sessions come in!
        sessions are a server-side data store that we use to make HTTP stateful. Instead
        of storing data using cookies, we store the data on the server-side and then send 
        the browser a cookies that can be used to retrieve the data.
